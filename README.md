# NanoTabICL: a minimal TabICLv2 implementation

| [Full TabICLv2 code](https://github.com/soda-inria/tabicl) | [TabICLv2 Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11139) |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|

This repository provides a short implementation of the [TabICLv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11139) architecture (<170 LOC)
and a slightly simplified implementation of the TabICLv2 prior (<330 LOC).
For using our pre-trained TabICLv2 model,
please visit the [main repository](https://github.com/soda-inria/tabicl). This repository also contains a compact
pre-training loop for experiments and reproduction attempts.

Compared to [nanoTabPFN](https://github.com/automl/nanoTabPFN),

- the model is TabICLv2, not TabPFN,
- we implement the full model (including RoPE, QASSMax, etc.) with speed optimizations
  (but without the inference wrappers + memory optimizations from the main repository),
- we implement regression as well,
- we provide a (slightly simplified but still well-performing) prior for dataset generation,
- we provide a small sklearn-compatible inference interface,
- we provide a minimal pre-training loop, but not the distributed and memory-optimized training system from the
  full repository.

Note that this repo uses LayerNorm with bias, which is used by the classification checkpoint of TabICLv2,
while the regression checkpoint of TabICLv2 uses LayerNorm without bias.

## Model usage

```python
from nanotabicl import NanoTabICLv2
import torch

batch_size, n_train, n_test, n_cols = 2, 32, 16, 10
model = NanoTabICLv2(max_classes=10, out_dim=10)  # original model size
X_train_and_test = torch.randn(batch_size, n_train+n_test, n_cols)
y_train = torch.randint(10, size=(batch_size, n_train)).float()
y_test_pred_logits = model(X_train_and_test, y_train)

# if you want a smaller model + regression with 999 quantiles instead
# warning: for regression, you need to standardize y yourself (and backtransform the output)
model = NanoTabICLv2(max_classes=0, out_dim=999, embed_dim=96,
                 col_num_blocks=2, row_num_blocks=2, icl_num_blocks=4,
                 col_nhead=4, row_nhead=4, icl_nhead=4)
y_train = torch.randn(batch_size, n_train)
y_test_pred_quantiles = model(X_train_and_test, y_train)
```

Note that `X_train_and_test` is standardized inside the model (based on train only).
We do not include other preprocessing options from TabICLv2
since they are normally not part of the architecture.

For a checkpoint, the sklearn-compatible wrappers apply the prior's preprocessing and average predictions over
random feature/class orders:

```python
from nanotabicl import NanoTabICLClassifier, NanoTabICLRegressor

clf = NanoTabICLClassifier(model="runs/small_two_target/latest.pt", n_estimators=8).fit(X_train, y_train)
proba = clf.predict_proba(X_test)

reg = NanoTabICLRegressor(model="runs/regression/latest.pt").fit(X_train, y_train)
quantiles = reg.predict_quantiles(X_test, alphas=(0.1, 0.5, 0.9))
pred = reg.predict(X_test)  # median prediction
```

## Training and evaluation


> **Warning:** the complete three-stage recipe is far too costly for a casual experiment. Stage 1 is 500,000
> optimizer steps, stage 2 adds 40,000 steps with sequences up to 10,240 rows, and stage 3 adds 10,000 steps with
> sequences up to 60,000 rows. It requires substantial GPU time, CPU data-generation capacity, storage, and memory. These configuration files are only included to replicate TabICLv2 actual setup.
> Use `configs/small.yaml` or override `optim.max_steps`, sequence lengths, and model size for quick experiments.


Install the package in editable mode (the optional dependencies add pytest, matplotlib, and Weights & Biases):

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
# if you get an error about Go not being installed to build wandb, try instead
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]" "wandb==0.21.4" 
```

The small configuration trains two categorical targets with the mean cross-entropy of
A|X, B|X, A|B,X, and B|A,X, plus `optim.lambda_fg` times their factorization gap.
The penalty defaults to zero. Conditional views append the other target as a feature:
observed values in context rows, enumerated class values in query rows. Both control
and penalized runs perform the same enumeration; conditional cross-entropy uses the
observed query label of the other target. Class probabilities are normalized over
each target's classes present in the context.

Use separate output directories and the same seed to compare objectives from the same initialization:

```bash
python -m nanotabicl.train configs/small.yaml optim.lambda_fg=0 seed=0 out_dir=runs/fg_control
python -m nanotabicl.train configs/small.yaml optim.lambda_fg=0.3 seed=0 out_dir=runs/fg_penalized
```

Logs include per-view cross-entropy and accuracy, mean `ce`, `factorization_gap`, and
total `loss`. Enumeration uses `2 + 2 * data.max_classes` forward passes per micro-batch.
For cheaper experiments, set `data.max_classes=4` in both runs; those models can only
evaluate tasks with up to four classes. Single-target training remains available with
`data.n_targets=1 optim.lambda_fg=0`.

To run and evaluate the default small configuration:

```bash
python -m nanotabicl.train configs/small.yaml
python -m nanotabicl.eval runs/small_two_target/latest.pt
```
Historical results from the original single-target small configuration (not the new two-target setup):
| Dataset | Score |
|---|---:|
| iris | 0.920 |
| wine | 0.966 |
| breast_cancer | 0.933 |
| digits | 0.904 |

### Classification and coherence evaluation

Compare checkpoints with identical context sizes and split seeds:

```bash
python -m nanotabicl.eval runs/fg_control/latest.pt runs/fg_penalized/latest.pt \
  --context-sizes 32 64 128 --seeds 0 1 2 --output runs/fg_comparison.json
```

The original Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer and Digits tasks report accuracy, log loss,
and multiclass Brier score. The additional benchmarks are:

| Dataset | A | B | Features excluded |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Car Evaluation (Bohanec)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation) | Acceptability | Safety | Both targets |
| [Nursery (Rajkovic)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/76/nursery) | Recommendation | Health | Both targets |
| [Student Performance (Cortez)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance) | G2 >= 10 | G3 >= 10 | G1, G2, G3 |

UCI datasets are CC BY 4.0; archives download once into `runs/eval_data`.
Math and Portuguese students are evaluated separately because the courses overlap.
Each paired benchmark reports accuracy, log loss and Brier score for A, B,
A given B, B given A, and each of the two joint factorizations, plus their mean
total-variation factorization gap. Brier scores sum over classes, then average
over examples; log loss uses natural logarithms and a probability floor of 1e-12.

Splits are uniform and fixed by seed, with up to 256 query rows. Category encodings
and feature preprocessing are fitted on context only. Rare labels are not dropped
or forced into context; classes absent from context get zero predicted probability,
and `unseen_a_rate` / `unseen_b_rate` report their query frequency. In particular,
Nursery has only two examples of the `recommend` class. Interpret gap alongside
prediction scores and these coverage diagnostics.

Paired tasks default to one ensemble member (`--n-estimators`); the original
benchmarks retain their eight-member estimator. Compare identical settings across
checkpoints and retain per-seed results rather than treating query rows as independent
training runs. The full suite requires capacity for ten classes; Nursery alone needs
five. `--skip-pairs` runs the original benchmarks without downloading UCI data.
Regression evaluation keeps its original datasets and R² calculation.

The reference stage-1 configurations are:

```bash
python -m nanotabicl.train configs/classification.yaml
python -m nanotabicl.train configs/regression.yaml
```

Training writes `latest.pt`, the resolved `config.yaml`, and `metrics.jsonl` to `out_dir`. If `latest.pt` already
exists, the run resumes automatically. To start the next curriculum stage from an earlier checkpoint, use a new output directory and `init_from`:

```bash
python -m nanotabicl.train configs/classification.yaml configs/stage2.yaml \
    init_from=runs/classification/latest.pt \
    out_dir=runs/classification_stage2

python -m nanotabicl.train configs/classification.yaml configs/stage2.yaml configs/stage3.yaml \
    init_from=runs/classification_stage2/latest.pt \
    out_dir=runs/classification_stage3
```

The same commands work with `configs/regression.yaml` in place of `configs/classification.yaml`.

Run the test suite with:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Nanoprior

In `nanotabicl/prior.py`, we provide a concise and slightly simplified
implementation of the TabICLv2 prior,
which nevertheless performs similarly well in our
(smaller-scale) experiments.
Changes compared to the TabICLv2 prior are:

- No correlated sampling of scalar variables / hyperparameters.
- Removed graph filtering (should be captured by dataset filtering anyway).
- No graph pruning of irrelevant nodes
(can be a bit slower, but yields the same output).
- Categorical converters with cardinality k always use k dimensions,
never fewer.
- Kumaraswamy warping now affects the extracted dataset column,
not the propagated value.
- Fixed the constant in the random EM function.
- The random activation used for random activation matrices
follows the general random activation now
by only using two of the four possible random power activation types.
- Use corrected categorical size limit of 100 instead of 10.
- Dataset filtering uses the same categorical sizes
in every attempt until a non-filtered dataset is generated.
- fill NaN/inf with zero instead of discarding the whole dataset.
- (Use torch.sign() in random activation,
which has a different behavior at 0 than `2*(x>=0).float()-1`.)

Preprocessing code (outlier handling, standard scaling)
is also not included as it could be done inside the model.

When running the prior module directly, it generates a plot of some random datasets.

## Updates

- 2026/08/17: Replace class-embedding with one-hot + linear, which has a bias compared to the nn.Embedding used before, and matches the full model implementation.
- 2026/06/10: Add nanoprior.
Bugfix based on [#2](https://github.com/soda-inria/nanotabicl/issues/2): Subtract mean when standardizing input data.
- 2026/03/25: Add faster + cached RoPE implementation based on the TabICLv2 version (warning: this permutes the neurons, so it's not compatible with older nanotabicl checkpoints).
- 2026/09/09: Add pretraining code and some evaluations for the trained checkpoints.
